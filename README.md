Genetics
========
The Genetics repo is to keep in one place all of the classes I'll need to create a good, dependable Genetic Algorithm.

It supports crossovers with or without mutations and allows the user to determine the percentage of mutations which are insertions, deletions and point.

As time goes on this repo may also come to hold examples of these classes in action!
